# Runtime Instance Manager & Channel Management Dashboard

## Overview

The ClawDen dashboard currently shows fleet status, agent health, task routing, config editing, and audit logs — but it lacks two critical operator workflows:

1. **Runtime Instance Management** — No way to deploy, install, or visually track Claw runtime instances (OpenClaw, Nanobot, PicoClaw, ZeroClaw, NanoClaw, IronClaw, TinyClaw, OpenFang — per [ClawCharts.com](https://clawcharts.com/)) from the dashboard. Operators can't see deployment state, trigger installs, or watch bootstrap progress.
2. **Channel / Bot Management** — No UI to configure messaging channels (Telegram, Slack, Discord, WhatsApp, etc.) and auto-bind them to deployed instances. Operators must hand-edit config files. Each runtime uses a different config format (JSON5, JSON, TOML, .env, WASM capabilities) and credential pattern.

This spec adds two new dashboard pages and their supporting backend APIs to close these gaps. Spec 017 (Docker Runtime Images) and spec 018 (Channel Support Matrix) define the backend foundations — this spec builds the frontend and API glue so operators can actually use them.

## Design

### Part 1: Runtime Instance Manager

#### New Dashboard Page — "Runtimes"

A new top-level nav item **Runtimes** in the sidebar (between Fleet and Tasks).

**A. Runtime Catalog** — Grid of available runtimes (8 per ClawCharts: OpenClaw, Nanobot, PicoClaw, ZeroClaw, NanoClaw, IronClaw, TinyClaw, OpenFang) with metadata from `AdapterRegistry::list_metadata()`:
- Name, language, version, star count, capabilities (chat, tools, vision, etc.)
- Status: Not installed / Installed / Has running instances
- Channel support cross-ref with spec 018 matrix (total channel count badge)
- **Deploy** button opens the deployment flow

**B. Instance List** — Table of deployed instances grouped by runtime:
- Instance name, runtime, lifecycle state badge, health indicator, uptime, host, connected channel badges
- Actions: Start / Stop / Restart / Configure / Logs

#### Deployment Flow

Multi-step wizard triggered by **Deploy** button:

1. **Configure** — Form: instance name, deployment target (Local / Docker / Remote), model provider + model name, channel selection, advanced env overrides
2. **Deploy** — Real-time progress: pulling image → installing runtime (`ClawAdapter::install()`) → applying config → starting instance (`ClawAdapter::start()`) → health check. Each step shows pending / spinner / checkmark / error
3. **Complete** — Instance appears in list with Running state, toast confirms success

#### Instance Detail Panel

Clicking an instance opens a side panel enhanced with:
- Deployment info (runtime version, container ID, deploy timestamp, target)
- Live log streaming (via SSE)
- Resource metrics sparklines (CPU / Memory from `ClawAdapter::metrics()`)
- Connected channels with per-channel status
- Restart / Stop / Redeploy with confirmation dialogs

#### New Backend Endpoints

| Endpoint                       | Method    | Purpose                                           |
| ------------------------------ | --------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `/runtimes`                    | GET       | List available runtimes with adapter metadata     |
| `/runtimes/{runtime}/deploy`   | POST      | Deploy new instance (install + configure + start) |
| `/agents/{id}/deploy-status`   | GET       | Deployment progress tracking                      |
| `/agents/{id}/logs`            | GET (SSE) | Stream agent logs                                 |
| `/agents/{id}/metrics/history` | GET       | Historical metrics for charting                   |

### Part 2: Channel / Bot Management

#### New Dashboard Page — "Channels"

A new top-level nav item **Channels** in the sidebar (after Runtimes).

**A. Channel Overview Grid** — Card per channel type (Telegram, Slack, Discord, WhatsApp, etc.):
- Configured instance count, connection status (Connected / Disconnected / Partial)
- Configure / View instances actions

**B. Channel Configuration Form** — Per-channel credential + policy form. Config format varies by runtime (spec 018):
- Telegram: bot token, allowed user IDs, group activation mode
- Slack: bot token + app token (Socket Mode), signing secret, allowed channels
- Discord: bot token, guild ID, allowed roles, intents bitmask
- WhatsApp: implementation type (Baileys / Meta Cloud API / Node bridge), phone/API key
- Signal, Feishu, DingTalk, generic webhook, etc.
- Assignment: multi-select which deployed instances use this channel
- Policy: allowlist mode, pairing code toggle, group mention-only toggle
- Credentials stored encrypted via secret vault (spec 013)

**C. Channel Status Matrix** — Real-time instance × channel status grid:
- Per-cell: Connected ✅ / Disconnected ❌ / Rate limited ⚠️ / Proxied 🔄
- Status updates stream via WebSocket

#### Auto-Configuration Flow

1. Operator configures channel + assigns instances in UI
2. ClawDen translates to each runtime's native config format (`RuntimeConfigTranslator`) — handles JSON5, JSON, TOML, .env, WASM capabilities
3. Pushes config to each instance (`ClawAdapter::set_config()`)
4. Monitors channel health, reports status back to dashboard

#### Channel Registry (Conflict Prevention)

Multiple claw instances sharing the same bot token causes conflicts: duplicate message processing, webhook endpoint collisions, polling API races, state corruption. Some runtimes detect this (ZeroClaw `channel doctor`, OpenClaw account namespacing) but most don't.

ClawDen enforces token uniqueness at the orchestrator level via a **Channel Registry**:

- **Token binding**: Each `(channel_type, bot_token_hash)` pair maps to exactly one instance. Attempting to assign a token already bound elsewhere is rejected.
- **Reservation lifecycle**: Bind on channel assignment, unbind on instance stop/delete. Status: `active` / `draining` / `released`.
- **Dashboard warnings**: Conflict detection UI shows if a token is in use by another instance, with option to reassign (unbind old → bind new).
- **Auto-routing (future)**: Single bot token → ClawDen webhook ingress → route to correct instance by conversation context.

Data model (`channel_bindings`):

| Field            | Type      | Constraint                   |
| ---------------- | --------- | ---------------------------- |
| `instance_id`    | UUID      | FK → agents                  |
| `channel_type`   | String    | telegram, discord, etc.      |
| `bot_token_hash` | String    | SHA-256 of token             |
| `status`         | Enum      | active / draining / released |
| `bound_at`       | Timestamp |                              |

Unique constraint: `(channel_type, bot_token_hash)` — one token, one instance.

#### Channel Proxy Indicator

For runtimes lacking native support (per spec 018 matrix), UI shows a "Proxy" badge. ClawDen bridges via channel proxy. Operator sees native vs proxied, proxy latency, and can disable per-channel.

#### New Backend Endpoints

| Endpoint                       | Method         | Purpose                                              |
| ------------------------------ | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `/channels`                    | GET            | List configured channel types with status            |
| `/channels/{type}`             | GET/PUT/DELETE | CRUD for channel config (credentials encrypted)      |
| `/channels/{type}/instances`   | GET/PUT        | Manage instance assignments                          |
| `/channels/{type}/test`        | POST           | Test channel credentials                             |
| `/agents/{id}/channels`        | GET            | Per-agent channel status                             |
| `/channels/matrix`             | GET            | Full channel × runtime support matrix                |
| `/channels/bindings`           | GET            | List all channel-instance bindings                   |
| `/channels/bindings`           | POST           | Bind channel token to instance (enforces uniqueness) |
| `/channels/bindings/{id}`      | DELETE         | Unbind (release) a channel token                     |
| `/channels/bindings/conflicts` | GET            | Detect token conflicts across instances              |
